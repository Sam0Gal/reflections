How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A: It saved me a lot of time and effort, it was really more comfortable!


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This will save me alot of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    For Git: It will be safer and more organized but it will take more time to manually doing this and may be exhausting to do this with many files.
automatically saving is more comfortable and will save time but it can be annoying to save something to don't want to save it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because changing anything in one file may affect all the other files, so it's good to save multiple file in one commit, but google drive commit file separately because the change of any file won't affect the other files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I use git log to view to all commits, and git diff to contrast two versoins of a file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can restore old versions of the files I made changes in with version control and somewhat easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to learn more and use it while working on a web project
